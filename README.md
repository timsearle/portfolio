# Welcome

### I am currently in the process of moving to a new web hosting provider! I'll re-host my existing blog content shortly but in the meantime, please take a look at some of my projects that I'm currently maintaining:

[Euclid](https://github.com/timsearle/euclid) - A great-circle mathemathics library, perfect for working with coordinates from CLLocation and performing common operations with bounding boxes and distance calculations.

[Eagle](https://apps.apple.com/za/app/eagle/id1071087462) - A small educational project I've been maintaining on and off since Swift 3. It harnesses Euclid, mentioned above, to tell you what countries are in the direction you angle your phone, after specifying the distance.

[Networking](https://github.com/karmarama/Networking) - an [objc.io](https://objc.io) Swift Talk resource based approach to networking. Light-weight wrapper around `URLSession`. Easily mockable via `RequestBehaviours`. 

[Bind](https://github.com/karmarama/Bind) - a functional reactive programming library that allows for easy binding between a type generic over the type it emits and your view. It's an extremely light-weight version of RxSwift, perfect for learning to think it terms of event streams without getting bogged down in too much detail.
